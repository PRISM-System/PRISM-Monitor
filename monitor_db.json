The user provided some data about the manufacturing process, specifically for a semiconductor fabrication. The task is to detect anomalies based on the given data and the normal ranges provided in the tables.\n\nFirst, I need to check each parameter in the data against its respective normal range. The user mentioned that only the parameters outside the normal range should be explained, and those within should be ignored. \n\nLooking at the data, there are several parameters. For example, in the SEMI_PHOTO_SENSORS table, parameters like EXPOSURE_DOSE, FOCUS_POSITION, STAGE_TEMP, etc., have specified normal ranges. The data includes values for these parameters. Let me check each one:\n\n- EXPOSURE_DOSE is 1.623... but the normal range is 20-40 mJ/cm\u00b2. Wait, the data here seems to be in a different format. Wait, looking at the user's previous examples, the data values might be normalized or scaled. Wait, in the first user example, the data had values like alignment_error_x: 1.78, but the normal range was -0.5 to 0.5. However, in the current data, the values are like alignment_error"}}, "EventCauseCandidatesHistory": {"1": {"causeCandidates": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided a data dictionary with various tables and columns related to semiconductor manufacturing processes. They also gave examples of previous interactions where the assistant analyzed anomaly data and provided recommendations. Now, the latest input is a summary of processing results: total_records=399, tables_processed=10, anomalies_detected=21, drift_detected=0, processing_time='2025-09-02T05:42:02.474682'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking for. The initial instruction says the agent is responsible for anomaly detection and monitoring in manufacturing processes. The user wants the agent to check which columns in the provided data have anomalies and generate an analysis based on that.\n\nLooking at the previous examples, the assistant identified specific sensors or parameters that were out of normal ranges and suggested analyses. For instance, in the first example, they mentioned alignment errors and sensor values affecting yield. In the second example, they pointed out beam current and resist uniformity issues.\n\nNow, the current data doesn't include specific sensor values or parameters but rather a summary of processing results. The challenge here is that the user hasn't provided"}}}
