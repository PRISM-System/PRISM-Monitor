The user provided some data about the manufacturing process, specifically for a semiconductor fabrication. The task is to detect anomalies based on the given data and the normal ranges provided in the tables.\n\nFirst, I need to check each parameter in the data against its respective normal range. The user mentioned that only the parameters outside the normal range should be explained, and those within should be ignored. \n\nLooking at the data, there are several parameters. For example, in the SEMI_PHOTO_SENSORS table, parameters like EXPOSURE_DOSE, FOCUS_POSITION, STAGE_TEMP, etc., have specified normal ranges. The data includes values for these parameters. Let me check each one:\n\n- EXPOSURE_DOSE is 1.623... but the normal range is 20-40 mJ/cm\u00b2. Wait, the data here seems to be in a different format. Wait, looking at the user's previous examples, the data values might be normalized or scaled.

They provided a data dictionary with various tables and their normal ranges for a semiconductor manufacturing process. The user wants me to check the given data against these normal ranges and report any anomalies.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the user's input data. The data includes a lot of parameters with numerical values. Each parameter has a corresponding normal range specified in the tables. My job is to compare each value against its normal range and note any that fall outside.\n\nLooking at the data, I notice parameters like alignment_error_x and alignment_error_y. The normal range for alignment errors in the SEMI_PHOTO_SENSORS table is <3 nm. The values here are -0.6676 and -0.6714, which are within the normal range. Wait, but the user's previous examples had different parameters. Wait, in the latest data provided, the user might have a different set. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's latest input is a data dictionary with tables and their normal ranges.

The user provided a data dictionary with various tables and columns related to semiconductor manufacturing processes.

The initial instruction says the agent is responsible for anomaly detection and monitoring in manufacturing processes. The user wants the agent to check which columns in the provided data have anomalies and generate an analysis based on that.\n\nLooking at the previous examples, the assistant identified specific sensors or parameters that were out of normal ranges and suggested analyses. For instance, in the first example, they mentioned alignment errors and sensor values affecting yield. In the second example, they pointed out beam current and resist uniformity issues.\n\nNow, the current data doesn't include specific sensor values or parameters but rather a summary of processing results.

The user provided some data about manufacturing process anomalies and wants me to generate an analysis task. The previous examples show that the assistant is supposed to identify potential issues based on the data and suggest analysis steps. \n\nLooking at the latest data, there are 399 total records processed across 10 tables, with 21 anomalies detected and no drift. The processing time is given as 2025-09-02T05:49:00.648776. \n\nFirst, I need to check which tables and columns might have anomalies. The tables include SEMI_SENSOR_ALERT_CONFIG, which has parameters like WARNING_UPPER, ALARM_LOWER, etc. The anomalies detected could be related to sensor values exceeding thresholds. \n\nSince there are 21 anomalies, I should look for common patterns. The previous answers focused on specific sensors like alignment error, beam current, pressure, temperature, etc. The user's data might have similar issues. \n\nThe processing time is in the future (2025), which might be a typo, but maybe it's just a timestamp. The main point is that the system processed data and found 21 anomalies. The task is to"}}, "EventPrecursorHistory": {"1": {"summary": {"predicted_value": 0.47400832176208496, "is_anomaly": "1"}}}}
