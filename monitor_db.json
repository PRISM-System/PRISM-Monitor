The user provided some data about the manufacturing process, specifically for a semiconductor fabrication.

The user mentioned that only the parameters outside the normal range should be explained, and those within should be ignored. \n\nLooking at the data, there are several parameters. For example, in the SEMI_PHOTO_SENSORS table, parameters like EXPOSURE_DOSE, FOCUS_POSITION, STAGE_TEMP, etc., have specified normal ranges. The data includes values for these parameters. Let me check each one:\n\n- EXPOSURE_DOSE is 1.623... but the normal range is 20-40 mJ/cm\u00b2. Wait, the data here seems to be in a different format.

The data includes a lot of parameters with numerical values. Each parameter has a corresponding normal range specified in the tables. My job is to compare each value against its normal range and note any that fall outside.\n\nLooking at the data, I notice parameters like alignment_error_x and alignment_error_y. The normal range for alignment errors in the SEMI_PHOTO_SENSORS table is <3 nm. The values here are -0.6676 and -0.6714, which are within the normal range.
