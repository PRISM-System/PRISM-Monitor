The processing time for the last table was completed on September 11, 2025 at 5:08:19 PM. These anomalies are consistent with the observed issues in the SEMI_SENSOR_ALERT_CONFIG table, which highlights potential sensor failures and alarm thresholds that may affect production quality.\n\nThe anomaly detection indicates that a significant portion of the data (18) is not meeting the expected parameters, suggesting possible equipment or sensor malfunctions.

This suggests that further monitoring and analysis should focus on maintaining this stability to ensure accurate production processes.\n\nFor example, in the SEMI_LOT_MANAGE table, the anomaly score for LOT24015A (93.4) is higher than the normal range, indicating potential issues with the process parameters. In the SEMI_PROCESS_HISTORY, the alignment errors (-0.67 and -0.67) are outside the normal range for the current step, suggesting possible equipment inconsistencies. These observations support the need for continued surveillance to prevent future failures.\n``` \n\nNow, you have generated a response using the previous model.
