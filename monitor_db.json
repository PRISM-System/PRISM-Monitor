This suggests that further monitoring and analysis should focus on maintaining this stability to ensure accurate production processes.\n\nFor example, in the SEMI_LOT_MANAGE table, the anomaly score for LOT24015A (93.4) is higher than the normal range, indicating potential issues with the process parameters. In the SEMI_PROCESS_HISTORY, the alignment errors (-0.67 and -0.67) are outside the normal range for the current step, suggesting possible equipment inconsistencies. These observations support the need for continued surveillance to prevent future failures.\n``` \n\nNow, you have generated a response using the previous model.
